<h3 id="hema">Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA)</h3>

<p>Differently from oriental martial arts, European-based systems show only a feeble direct line of tradition up to our days, mainly 
    in the three schools of Olympic fencing (foible, épee and sabre). These doctrines have gradually been shaped by technological, political 
    and social changes across centuries of European history and obviously have little to do with the actual martial practice of the 
    18th century CE military sabre, let alone that of the Italian or German longsword during the 15th and 16th centuries CE. Luckily for us, the 
    masters of the past composed manuals and treatises: there, techniques with specific weapons are detailed together with instructions
    for a correct execution, so that (often with painstaking work of reconstruction) the teaching system can be brought back to life. </p>
<figure class="left">
    <img style="margin: 2px; border-radius: 8px; " src="../media/meyer.jpg" width="300">

    <p>HEMA focuses on the study of weapons that to our 21st-century-men imagination appear old-fashioned: rapiers, daggers or the aforementioned longswords
    populate our fantasies about gallant iron-clad knights or swashbuckling heroes in a dazzling Musketeer uniform. Together with the field 
    practice, though, the study of the primary sources and their interpretation constitutes an important part of the activity. For these reasons, 
    practicing HEMA is a matter of precision, elegance and speed in the movements and execution as much as of analysis and intuition in the
    interpretation of the words of the master, and as such it requires at the very least a working knowledge of the historical context when the 
    treatise was written.</p>
    <p>I have been practicing Japanese martial arts (Judo and Aikido) for most of my life. One of the arguments usually held up 
    in favour of these disciplines to the detriment of HEMA is the assumption of a moral ground of superiority: due to a superficial understanding of the 
    matter, the heavy philosophical background typical of Oriental martial arts is deemed absent in their Western counterparts. After having practiced HEMA, 
    I can confidently say this is not the case. European martial practice, especially since the 15th century CE, was imbued with the same ideals that 
    inspired the Renaissance, with the very same ambition to realise the "Vitruvian Man", the archetypal representation of all the best qualities of mankind. 
    As such, the fencing education was not about fencing alone, but (just like Budo) at a deeper level aimed to educate disciples and build their character in the 
    framework of a universal education.</p>
