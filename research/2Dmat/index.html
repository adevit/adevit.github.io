<p>The discovery of graphene in 2004 kickstarted a considerable amount of research into two-dimensional (2D) systems. Little was in fact known in practice about the behaviour
    of a material when confined into a purely 2D state, i.e. a single atomic layer. A lot of theoretical efforts had been diverted since the 1970s towards the study of these systems, and
    finally an experimental realization was demonstrated to be possible.<br>
    One of the most conspicuous members in the family of 2D materials is atomically thin magnets. It is somehow surprising that 2D magnets have been eluding physicists for
    so long, since weakly bonded van der Waals crystals have been available for decades. The simple exfoliation into thinner layers that carried Geim and Novoselov is in principle easily applicable 
    to other layered materials.<br>
    The question of whether long-range magnetic order existing in the bulk would persist in the 2D limit is far from a trivial one. Indeed, thermal instabilities in magnetic systems 
    manifest in the form of spin waves, collective excitations of the spin lattice. According to the Mermin-Wagner theorem, an important result of statistical physics, their energy distribution
    is intimately connected to the number of spatial dimensions: in 2D (or lower) systems, spin waves would destroy long-range order at any finite temperature. In order to realize
    magnetism in the 2D limit, a spin wave excitation gap is needed: in van der Waals materials this is provided by magnetocrystalline anisotropy, intrinsically present due to the reduced
    symmetry of their layered structure. A breakthrough was achieved in 2017, with the demonstration of ferromagnetism in CrGeTe and CrI3. Since then, the field has grown to maturity and a plethora
    of 2D magnets have been observed experimentally.<br>
    My research focuses on the study of the electronic properties in 2D magnets: I investigate orbital ordering, spin configuration, and fundamental excitations, to better understand how to harness
    their unique properties in view of applications in advanced technologies. One main target is the interplay between spin, valley, and layer degrees of freedom, together with dimensionality effects. 
    Strong spatial confinement exacerbates Coulomb interactions, affecting the degree of electron-electron correlations and supporting rich exciton physics even at room temperature. 
    This phenomenology becomes even more complex and exciting when stacking single layers of different 2D materials: properties resulting from interface effects, such as band alignment 
    or charge-transfer phenomena, are strongly material-dependent, with a lot of wiggle room for tailoring the desired properties. Additionally, the emergence of effects such as moiré band folding is
    stacking-dependent, and the twist angle between atomic layers becomes another powerful control knob. I aim to study the fundamental exciton properties (binding energy, lifetime, localization) and how
    they interact with orbital, valley, and spin ordering. The unique set of parameters available in a complex photoemission experiment allows also to reconstruct key phase information
    pertaining to the complex-valued Bloch functions underlying electronic orbitals, turning my approach into an ultrafast wavefunction recorder. 
    
     of particular interest for applications towards next-generation devices.

<p>Unconventional magnetism.
   It was indeed surprising that a complete classification of the spin-group symmetries included not two, but three categories: ferromagnetism, antiferromagnetism and altermagnetism 
    This novel notion was, so to speak, hiding in plain sight.
